# Project Requirements (MVP)

## Core Platform Requirements
- Showcase Hage studio profile/information page - A dedicated section presenting the studio's history, mission, and team.
- List WebGL games developed by Hage studio - Display a grid or list of games with thumbnails and basic information.
- Allow users to launch and play these games in the browser - Games should load directly in an iframe without requiring downloads.
- Basic responsive design for desktop and mobile - Ensure the platform works on various device sizes with minimum breakpoints.
- User registration and login - Simple authentication system to track player progress and preferences.

## Game Integration Requirements
- Support for uploading and serving Hage's Unity WebGL game builds - Admins can upload Unity WebGL exports and the system handles deployment.
- Display game titles and thumbnails - Each game needs a representative image and clear title.
- Basic game descriptions - Short text description explaining the game concept and gameplay.
- Proper MIME type configuration for WebGL assets - Ensure all game assets (.data, .wasm, etc.) are served with correct headers.
- Cross-browser compatibility for WebGL content - Test functionality on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## User Features (MVP Core)
- User registration (email/password) - Simple form with validation and confirmation.
- User login - Secure authentication with session management.
- Session persistence - Remember users between visits using cookies/sessions.
- (Optional MVP Stretch) Basic game progress saving - Simple mechanism to store and retrieve game progress per user.
- Basic error handling - User-friendly error messages for common issues.

## Administrative Features (MVP Core)
- Admin interface for uploading new game builds - Secure form for uploading and extracting game zip files.
- Admin interface for adding/editing game titles and descriptions - Simple CRUD operations for game metadata.
- Basic user management - View registered users and basic management options.
- Game visibility controls - Enable/disable game visibility on the platform.
- Basic dashboard with usage statistics - Simple metrics on game plays and user registrations.

## Performance Requirements (MVP Target)
- Reasonable game loading times on decent connections - Initial game load under 5 seconds on broadband.
- Basic optimization for web delivery - Compression of assets where appropriate.
- Proper caching headers for static assets - Configure cache control for efficient asset delivery.
- Optimized image assets - Properly sized and compressed thumbnails and images.
- Database query optimization - Avoid N+1 problems and unnecessarily complex queries.

## Security Requirements (MVP Baseline)
- Secure user authentication (password hashing) - Use Laravel's built-in authentication with proper password hashing.
- Protection against basic XSS and CSRF using framework defaults - Leverage Laravel's security features.
- Input validation - Validate all user inputs server-side.
- Secure file uploads - Restrict file types and scan uploads for security issues.
- Basic rate limiting - Prevent abuse of authentication and key API endpoints.
