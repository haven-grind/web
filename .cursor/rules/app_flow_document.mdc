# Application Flow (MVP)

## User Journey (MVP)
1. **Discovery**: User lands on homepage showing studio info and list of games - Homepage serves as the main entry point with clear navigation.
2. **Selection**: User clicks on a game thumbnail/title - Game cards are interactive and provide visual feedback on hover/interaction.
3. **Gameplay**: User is taken to a game page and the game launches within an iframe - Game page includes game title, description, and embedded WebGL game.
4. **Authentication**: User can optionally register or log in via dedicated links/pages - Authentication flows are simple and non-intrusive.

## Game Integration Flow (MVP)
1. **Upload**: Admin uses a simple dashboard page to upload a game zip file, title, description, and thumbnail - Form includes file validation and progress indication.
2. **Processing**: System saves game info to DB and stores unzipped files locally - Files are extracted to appropriate directories with proper permissions.
3. **Publication**: Game appears on the public games list - Newly added games can be featured or sorted by upload date.

## Authentication Flow (MVP)
1. **Registration**: New users register with email and password on a registration page - Includes basic validation and feedback.
2. **Login**: Users log in with credentials on a login page - Clear error messages for failed login attempts.
3. **Session**: System maintains login state using standard Laravel sessions - Reasonable timeout period and secure cookie settings.
4. **Logout**: User clicks a logout button - Provides clear feedback that logout was successful.
